# Ramana Reddy's Portfolio

I have built this portfolio using **TailwindCSS**, **React**, and libraries like **react-icons** and **framer-motion**.  
It showcases my work in Data Science, Generative AI, RAG systems, and MLOps.  
Hope you like it!

## Steps involved
In case you want to replicate this:

1. Create an app using `create-react-app` or Vite
2. Setup Tailwind CSS using https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite
3. Clone the code
4. Change the data in the `constants` folder to your details
5. Replace images in the `assets` folder with your own
6. Refer to the react-icons documentation to display icons for your tech stack
7. Deploy the code using GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify
